# Drone Navigation Service API

## Story
Space exploration is underway and mostly done by private companies. You joined
Engineering department of one of the private government contractors, Atlas Corporation.
In that year and age, everything is automated, so survey and data gathering is done by drones.
Unfortunately, although drones are perfectly capable of gathering the data, they have issues
with locating databank to upload gathered data. You, as the most promising recruit of Atlas
Corp, were tasked to develop a drone navigation service (DNS):
- each observed sector of the galaxy has unique numeric SectorID assigned to it
- each sector will have at least one DNS deployed
- each sector has different number of drones deployed at any given moment
- itâ€™s future, but not that far, so drones will still use JSON REST API

## Goal
To create a microservice API that can helps drones get location of databank.
